# MiniBot
Code for the 2129 Mini Robot.
This code includes functioning pneumatics making it the only MiniBot file in our orginization with this capability.
I have also included a function that makes the controller rumble based on how far the drive stick has been pushed but you can comment it out if you want to.
The code currently runs an Xbox controller but it would be easy to switch it to a Joystick.
You are free to use this code how you want but dont change it without permission.
